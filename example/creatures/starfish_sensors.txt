List of sensors:

* angle of center
* angular velocity of center
* angle of control group wrt center or previous control group (skeleton proprioception)
* angular velocities of those angles
* detect touching on either side of a control group

* lidar (to plan?)


Diversity features:

* mean height of the center body
* mean angle of the center body
* accumulated angle of the center body (redundant with precedent?)
* mean horizontal velocity (same as end position?)
* mean absolute vertical velocity?
